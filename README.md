# Phoenix/Elm Quickstart

This repository can be used to bootstrap a new Phoenix v1.2.1 aplication that is
integrated with an Elm frontend. This application is a minor variation of the
Phoenix "hello world" application but has a small "hello elm" application
embedded in the Phoenix view.

To use this repository:

  * Clone this repo
  * cd <app dir>
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create your database with `mix ecto.create
  * Install node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
